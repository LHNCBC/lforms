# Support for FHIR Structured Data Capture

The following is a terse listing of our support for the Structured Data Capture
(SDC) FHIR Implementation Guide.  For more details about the items listed here,
see:  https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/sdc/index.html

For the expression extensions mentioned below, we do not support CQL, but do
support FHIRPath and x-fhir-query where appropriate for the extension.

The following lists are organized by the sections of the SDC implementation
guide (IG).

## Supported Features
### Advanced Rendering
See https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/sdc/rendering.html for descriptions of these
fields.
* rendering-style:  on item.text and prefix
* rendering-xhtml:  on item.text, but only for itemControl of type "help", and
  it does not perform any sanization, and allows any HTML, so please consider
  security issues before using.
* hidden
* itemControl:  Support for types:  gtable, table, drop-down, autocomplete,
  radio-button, check-box, help.  Note that type "list" is the default type of
  display, so that is supported, and the extension is not needed for that case.
